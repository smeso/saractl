.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
This man page describes the format of S.A.R.A.\(aqs WX Protections configuration
files. See \fIsara(7)\fP for an overview of S.A.R.A. or
\fIsaractl(8)\fP for an overview of the program used to manage
S.A.R.A\(aqs configuration.
.SH FORMAT
.sp
The configuration format is line oriented. Comments starts with \fI#\fP,
inline comments are supported. Every line is made up of two parts
seperated by a whitespace. The first part is the file path,
in case it contains a whitespace itself, the string can be enclosed in
double quotes or escaped. The path can be terminated with a \(aq*\(aq to make
it match every path that starts with the chosen prefix.
The second part is the flags list. It\(aqs a case in\-sensitive and comma
separated list of the flags that need to be enabled. It can include
whitespaces before or after the commas.
Files in the \fI/etc/sara/wxprot.conf.d/\fP directory are read in lexycografical
order and merged together at the end of \fI/etc/sara/wxprot.conf\fP as if
they were a single big file.
In general, lines order doesn\(aqt matter, the rule with the most specific
path has precedence. In case of multiple entries with \fIexactly\fP the same
path, the first one has precedence and others are discarded.
.SS Flags
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B WXORX
Prevents any page of memory from being marked as
both writable and executable at the same time.
.TP
.B STACK
Prevents any page of memory in the stack from
becoming executable if it could have been
written in the past. (Depends on WXORX)
.TP
.B HEAP
Prevents any page of memory in the heap from
becoming executable if it could have been
written in the past. (Depends on WXORX)
.TP
.B OTHER
Prevents any other page of memory from becoming
executable if it could have been written in
the past. (Depends on WXORX)
.TP
.B MPROTECT
Enables WXORX, STACK, HEAP and OTHER
.TP
.B MMAP
Prevents new executable mmap after
the dynamic libraries have been loaded.
(Depends on OTHER)
.TP
.B FULL
Enables MPROTECT and MMAP.
.TP
.B EMUTRAMP
Enables trampoline emulation, if trampoline
emulation is missing, it\(aqs changed to whatever
is set in "wxprot_emutramp_missing_default".
(Depends on MPROTECT and conflicts with any
other EMUTRAMP*)
.TP
.B EMUTRAMP_OR_MPROTECT
Like EMUTRAMP but, if trampoline emulation
is missing, it\(aqs changed to MPROTECT.
(Depends on MPROTECT and conflicts with any
other EMUTRAMP*)
.TP
.B EMUTRAMP_OR_NONE
Like EMUTRAMP but, if trampoline emulation
is missing, all the flags are replaced with
NONE. (Depends on MPROTECT and conflicts with
any other EMUTRAMP*)
.TP
.B VERBOSE
Verbosely report every violation. (Depends on
WXORX)
.TP
.B COMPLAIN
Don\(aqt actually block anything. If VERBOSE
is enabled too S.A.R.A will reports violations.
(Depends on WXORX)
.TP
.B TRANSFER
Child tasks will inherit this task\(aqs flags
despite what is written in the configuration.
.TP
.B NONE
Disables everything.
